# Business Need:
The business need for the "Room For Rent" website is to provide a reliable and easily accessible
platform for people in Bangladesh to find rental housing. The lack of a centralized platform for
rental housing has made it difficult for people to find suitable housing quickly and easily. By
grouping all available rental houses in one place, the website aims to save people time and
money, and help them find suitable housing more efficiently. In addition, the website aims to
address the issue of accessibility for people who may face challenges in physically visiting rental
businesses, as well as those who may be seeking temporary housing on short notice. By
providing an online platform, the website aims to bridge this gap and make the process of
finding rental housing more inclusive and convenient. The success of the project will be
measured by the number of users who are able to find suitable housing through the website, as
well as the frequency of repeat visits by users. Ultimately, the website aims to establish itself as a
trusted and reliable source for rental housing in Bangladesh.


# Business Requirement:

This website will have two different types of users. One is the customers who want to rent a
property or a room and the second type of customers are the owners of the properties, who will
upload their property information for rent. The features and functionality of this system are given

1. The house owners can sign up using their NID, Passport, Driving License, or any

# Business Values:

The business value of the "Room For Rent" project lies in its ability to provide a
centralized and easily accessible platform for people in Bangladesh to find rental
housing. By addressing the lack of a reliable and comprehensive online resource for
rental properties, the project has the potential to save users time and money while
also providing greater access to housing for those who may have faced challenges in
finding it in the past. The project's success will be measured by the number of users
who are able to find suitable housing through the website, as well as the frequency
of repeat visits and positive reviews from satisfied users. In addition, the project has
the potential to generate revenue through rental fees charged to landlords and
property managers, as well as through potential partnerships with other businesses
in the housing market. Ultimately, the "Room For Rent" project aims to establish
itself as a trusted and valuable resource for rental housing in Bangladesh, with the
potential to make a significant social and economic impact.

2. Increasing traffic on the website will increase ad revenue. A typical website with
10,000 traffic per month is estimated to generate about 12,00,000 tk per year.

searching for rental properties.
4. Improved access to rental housing for people who may have previously faced
barriers such as physical mobility or lack of information.

more easily and quickly.

improve overall well-being and lead to increased productivity and economic
growth.

not speak or read English fluently.
